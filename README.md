The project aim to build a simple home-made cheap Satellite Tracker that moves a dual band antenna to the Azimuth and Elevation received by tracker software, the parts are really basics, I did use: 

1 Arduino (any one)

1 CNC shield and 2 motor drivers (I did use CNC Shield V3 with DRV8825, but you can use any)

1 Reset button (optional)

1 Power switch (optional)

2 units of Step Motors, I did use Nema 17

The image below is a simple representation of the build:
